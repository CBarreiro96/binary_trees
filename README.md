* **ROOT:** is the node with no parents. How you can see the image is A
* **LEAF** is a node with no children. In the image we can E, J, K ,H and I are leaf.
* **DEPTH OF A NODE** is the length of the path from the root to the node
* **HEIGHT OF A NODE** is the length of the path from that node to the deepest node. For example in the image the height of B is 2 (B – F – J).
* **SIZE OF A NODE** is the number of of descendants it has including itself for example the size of the subtree C is 3
* **FULL NODE** are nodes which has both left and right children as non-empty.
* **PERFECT BINARY TREE**  is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

* **SIBLING** are children of same parent
* **UNCLE OF A NODE** are siblings of that node's parent.
## :book: Learning :book:
In this part, you find  some question that you should to learn in this exercise, in this part there are some definition about this question, however if you feel that you need to find a lot of other information you can search in google and in the next section("information") you can  read these.

Before to respond  a would like to introduce about the tree:

**Tree** is  is recursively defined as a set of one or more nodes where one node is designated as the root of the tree and all the remaining nodes can be partitioned into non-empty sets each of which is a sub-tree of the root.

In the trees you can find 6 **types** of tree:

1) *General trees*
2) *Forest*
3) *Binary trees*
4) *Binary search trees*
5) *expression trees*
6) *Tournament trees*

Already, you have known the types of tree we are3 going to know the binary tree 
1)   **What is a binary tree**

2) **What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree**

	  Compare | Binary tree | search binary
	  --- | --- | ---
	  Definition | Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure in which a child can have zero, one, or maximum two child nodes that  there's not particular order to how the nodes should be organized in the tree| It is a variant of binary tree  in which the nodes are arranged in an order
	  Operation | Binary tree can be anything that has two children and one parent.(OPeration insertion, deletion and traversal) | Binary search trees are more of sorted binary trees that allows for fast and efficient lookup(Insertion and deletion of item)

  
3) **What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists**
4) **What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree**
5) **What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree**
6) **What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree**

* Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure

#### [SIZE](https://github.com/CBarreiro96/binary_trees/blob/master/11-binary_tree_size.c)
Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree

* Prototype: size_t binary_tree_size(const binary_tree_t *tree);
* Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to measure the size
* If tree is NULL, the function must return 0
